Suggest 5 concise commit messages for the following changes in my project.
Use the format: `type(module name): commit message` where `type` can be one of the following based on the nature of the changes:
- `feature(module name)`: for adding new features
- `fix(module name)`: for fixing bugs, typos, or issues
- `chore(module name)`: for maintenance or non-functional changes
- `style(module name)`: for code style changes (formatting, missing semi colons, etc.)
- `ref(module name)`: for code refactoring
- `perf(module name)`: for performance improvements
- `docs(module name)`: for documentation updates
- `build(module name)`: for changes that affect the build system or dependencies
- `ci/cd(module name)`: for changes to CI/CD configuration files and scripts

Please strictly follow the `type` guidelines based on the description of the changes,
and return only the commit messages without additional explanations and don't return my changes to me again just the commit message.
if specific module or project has most meaningful changed please set its name or boundary of changes else remove Parentheses and module name, also i want just set last part of project name 

i only want to see your suggested commit messages in the top of your response.
